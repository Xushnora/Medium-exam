        As Richard Branson said, “Don’t become a slave to technology — manage your phone, don’t let it manage you.”
    
        Unfortunately, most people are glued to their smartphones. Here are some worrying statistics about smartphone usage:
    
        46% of smartphone users spend between 5–6 hours per day on their smartphone
        The average adult spends 3 hours and 54 minutes on their mobile devices per day
        On average, we pick up our smartphones between 150–344 times per day (that’s once every 4 minutes)
        During the pandemic, daily smartphone usage has nearly doubled among children
        Fortunately, one of the most effective ways to spend less time on your smartphone is to have a clear list of productive, healthy, and fulfilling replacement activities.
    
        The more you practice these replacement activities, the less time you’ll waste on your smartphone.
    
        Learning New Skills
        Most people claim they ‘don’t have enough time’ to learn new skills or read more books. This is a lazy excuse. The problem is not lack of time, it’s lack of time management. Each day, hours are being wasted on distractions and low-quality entertainment.
    
        As Richard Koch, author of The 80/20 Principle, said, “It is not shortage of time that should worry us, but the tendency for the majority of time to be spent in low-quality ways.”
    
        What if each day, you traded 30 minutes of mindless phone scrolling for 30 minutes of learning a new skill?
    
        Whether learning high-value skills to make more money, new languages to emerge yourself in different cultures, or party tricks to show off to your friends, there are dozens of skills to learn.
    
        Where scrolling through your phone provides a temporary high — the dopamine spike is short-lived — learning a new skill will stick with you for years, if not an entire lifetime.`,

        Have you had enough of if-else complex nesting? I may give you some suggestions to improve the extensibility of the code.
    
        In a complex business system, there are often various complex conditional judgment logics. You need to write different code logic to check different conditional branches.

        You need to consider all possible situations to ensure that your code is right. With the addition of requirements, the conditional logic in the code becomes more and more complex. At this time, you will find that your function is quite long.

        What’s more, you don’t dare to modify this code easily. Every time you change the requirements, you need to be careful to ensure that the code you modified is right. Today, I’ll show you four ways to simplify annoying conditional expressions.

        At first glance, there is nothing interesting going on in this email. However, if you are observant (=if you pay close attention to things), you will note a few useful points that you can start using in your workplace communication.
    
        So, what can we note about this email?
        
        #1 It is informal
        Note that the author uses a contraction (“w”) instead of typing out the full word (“with”). This is totally acceptable in modern-day tech communication.
        
        When you use contractions, though, make sure they:
        
        will be understood by the recipients of your message
        actually save time and help make your message more readable
        #2 It is relaxed
        Reading this email feels like talking to a friend rather than a boss or a subordinate. That’s because most tech companies are not built as top-down hierarchies. Instead, they have more of a flat structure where everyone is equal, and the communication style reflects that.
        
        #3 It is personal and friendly
        Here’s one cool communication trick: use phrasal verbs when you want to sound friendly.
        
        Note that in this email, the author uses the phrasal verb “I will get back to you” instead of “I will contact you again”.
        
        The takeaway is that phrasal verbs always sound friendlier and less formal than the “regular” words.
        
        Let’s compare:
        
        
        That brings me to my next point.
        
        Friendly does NOT mean inappropriate.
        
        When you use a friendly tone in your written communication, it is still important to be respectful and make a positive impression. Expressing feelings of anger, frustration, resentment, etc. is a big no-no.
        
        How can you make sure you’re friendly and appropriate at the same time?
        
        Use positive-sounding language
        Avoid finger-pointing statements
        Pro tip: Change “you” statements to “I” statements. For example, instead of saying “You never told me about this event” say “I don’t remember discussing this event”.
        
        Now, imagine a situation.
        
        You’re in a zoom room waiting for someone you have scheduled a meeting with to show up. Ten minutes go by, and they’re still nowhere to be seen. What do you do?
        
        You can email them with a reminder, as I did in this message.
        Does this email give you the impression that I was angry writing it?
    
        No. Was I angry? Well, yeah. A bit. Who likes a no-show (=a person who is expected to be somewhere but doesn’t arrive)?
    
        You might have noticed that this reminder checks off all three important boxes:`,

            1. How to write digital products with personality. It’s possible to add character to your product in many ways — with colors, fonts, illustrations, and more. Nick DiLallo highlights how choosing the right words at the right time will shape the entire user experience.

            2. Tackling complex design debt. Inconsistent product functionality, wildly differing UI components, and conflicting terminology can have significant consequences for your business — if left unchecked. Alex Potrivaev, Senior Product Designer at Intercom, shares a simple three-step framework for managing it.
      
            3. How Atlassian’s design teams go from idea to execution. Natalie Coy took to Invision’s blog to offer a behind-the-scenes look at Atlassian’s design process. And the team was gracious enough to share their top Confluence templates to help teams like yours. Check it out.

            This comprehensive article contains the best professional UX writer resume examples and practices to help you land a job. Here is a list of the subjects we will be studying in-depth:
        
            Great examples of UX writer skills on a resume
            Abilities and skills that you need to include on your resume
            What you can do to set yourself apart from other candidates
            Resume tips for UX writers, including what to include and what not to include
            How to Write a UX Writer Resume
            The process of writing a resume is similar to the process of writing UX copy. As a UX writer, you develop content that is relevant, concise, helpful, and clear to assist users in completing their objectives. In this case, the content is your resume and your user is the hiring manager. However, that’s the last step to think about. The first step is you as a UX writer need to understand the product(s) in question (e.g. the company that you want to work at), and you are required to undertake user research (who’s looking at your resume).
            
            Keep in mind that when you’re preparing your resume, the hiring manager will evaluate your abilities as a problem-solver.
            
            Many UX writers waste their time by referring to the following from a bird’s eye view:
            
            Writing blog articles
            Writing press releases
            Working on multiple projects
            Working with stakeholders
            Collaborating with team members
            Working in a high-paced environment
            This is boring because it’s either irrelevant or expected. For the last three points, these are the terms that everyone is using. If you’re like everyone, then you’re no one. Just another discarded resume.
            
            So, how do you differentiate yourself? Do you know what information hiring managers and recruiters appreciate seeing on a resume? How about these skills:
            
            Understanding of design principles
            Know-how of creating conversational chatbots
            Website creation experience
            Ability to lead UX projects
            Ability to push large UX projects over the goal line
            Managing, editing, and creating content style guides
            Designing product information architecture
            Writing copy for error messages and empty states
            Using UX design skills to create low-fidelity prototypes
            Be specific and talk about how your work has helped users.
            
            What is the Best UX Writer Resume Format?
            There are three good ways to write a resume for a UX writing role.
            
            Reverse Chronological (most recent work experience first)
            Combination (ATS compliant)
            Functional (non-ATS compliant)
            If you want to hire a UX writer, you need to make their resume compatible with ATS (Applicant Tracking Software). Did you know that 98 percent of Fortune 500 companies use ATS to find out which resumes aren’t worth reading?
            
            All resumes are scanned by an ATS, which only accepts those with the right keywords in them. There is no need for hiring managers to go through all UX writer resumes. This saves them time and effort.
